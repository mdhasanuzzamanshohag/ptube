                            <p>An API is a set of definitions and protocols for
                                building and integrating application software.
                                It's sometimes referred to as a contract between
                                an information provider and an information
                                userâ€”establishing the content required from the
                                consumer (the call) and the content required by
                                the producer (the response). For example, the
                                API design for a weather service could specify
                                that the user supply a zip code and that the
                                producer reply with a 2-part answer, the first
                                being the high temperature, and the second being
                                the low.</p>

                                In other words, if you want to interact with a
                                computer or system to retrieve information or
                                perform a function, an API helps you communicate
                                what you want to that system so it can
                                understand and fulfill the request.
